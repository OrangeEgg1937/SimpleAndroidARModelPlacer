# SimpleAndroidARModelPlacer
 
### Welcome to my mini project
The idea of the project is basically using Android device to put your model in an AR scenes (Using Unity AR foundation - plane ONLY). It ONLY work on Android.

Since the project file is very large, I only provide the asset and the code. The model is base on a FINAL FANTASY XIV, and the pose implementation is using BlendShapes.

```
